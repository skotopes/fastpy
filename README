This is fastcgi to python WSGI gateway, written in c++, supports PEP333 excluding write()
it can speed up WSGI python application up to 500% (mainly on simple and quick answers)

It`s extremely experimental and dirty implementation, was written just for fun.
This project is partially abandoned, send me message if it`s interesting for you.
